                        I am working towards my Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering. I will be using my 
                        education to help me gain the skills I need to succeed as a programmer in a variety 
                        of fields with emphasis in game design and development. This has been accomplished 
                        through making small games each designed to represent a simple concept or mechanic 
                        with application in video game creation

                        I am very passionate about the value of gaming experiences whether that be in a 
                        digital form or in many popular tabletop game systems. I play in and organize multiple 
                        game systems which has given me a strong foundation in understanding game mechanics and 
                        balance. I have worked on many independent game design projects as well as the creation 
                        of multiple tabletop game systems.
