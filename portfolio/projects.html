                        <p>
                        My past work consists of a combination of independent projects and 
                        major assignments that I tailored to the game design field. One of the 
                        earliest projects I completed is a short text adventure game showcasing 
                        made to showcase writing and story creation skills. The adventure follows 
                        a “choose-your-own” format following a pattern of user choices to create 
                        alternate endings based on decisions made.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                        The second completed project is an evolution of the Choose Your Adventure 
                        format. It follows the same basic format while incorporating character data 
                        into the decision resolution process. The user may choose from a number of 
                        character options which help determine their playstyle. These character values 
                        are held in additional files referenced during decision-making events throughout 
                        the game. I also completed a modular encounter system that pulls opponent data 
                        from files to create a variety of interactions for the user to experience with 
                        alternate resolution methods based on the kinds of enemies faced.

                        I am still working on new projects to enhance my knowledge and skills. 
                        My current work is focused around a more complete game concept. The game 
                        is a semi-procedural exploration game with a unique traversal mechanic. 
                        Players traverse the world through the use of different grappling hooks 
                        which interact differently with the environment. The hook mechanic serves 
                        as a challenge in creating physics-based tools and interactions with the 
                        game environment and player.
