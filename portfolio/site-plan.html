        This site is a representation of my work in the field of Game Design and Development. Contained here is my personal resume and descriptions of relevant skills for Software Development and programming careers. There are also samples of projects I have completed and descriptions of ongoing projects which showcase my development skills. I am very passionate about the creative process behind game design and devote my energy towards making fun and engaging experiences for the people I design for.
        I am working towards my Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering. I will be using my education to help me gain the skills I need to succeed as a programmer in a variety of fields with emphasis in game design and development. This has been accomplished through making small games each designed to represent a simple concept or mechanic with application in video game creation. 
        I am very passionate about the value of gaming experiences whether that be in a digital form or in many popular tabletop game systems. I play in and organize multiple game systems which has given me a strong foundation in understanding game mechanics and balance. I have worked on many independent game design projects as well as the creation of multiple tabletop game systems.

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        My past work consists of a combination of independent projects and major assignments that I tailored to the game design field. One of the earliest projects I completed is a short text adventure game showcasing made to showcase writing and story creation skills. The adventure follows a “choose-your-own” format following a pattern of user choices to create alternate endings based on decisions made. 
        The second completed project is an evolution of the Choose Your Adventure format. It follows the same basic format while incorporating character data into the decision resolution process. The user may choose from a number of character options which help determine their playstyle. These character values are held in additional files referenced during decision-making events throughout the game. I also completed a modular encounter system that pulls opponent data from files to create a variety of interactions for the user to experience with alternate resolution methods based on the kinds of enemies faced.
        I am still working on new projects to enhance my knowledge and skills. My current work is focused around a more complete game concept. The game is a semi-procedural exploration game with a unique traversal mechanic. Players traverse the world through the use of different grappling hooks which interact differently with the environment. The hook mechanic serves as a challenge in creating physics-based tools and interactions with the game environment and player.

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        I have developed a wide variety of industry relevant skills to show myself as a valuable asset. I have a strong understanding of a multitude of programming languages which includes: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C# and C. I have applied these languages actively in front-end web design, database management, and various other programming projects.
	      I am an extremely efficient worker which directly benefits my programming by helping me create clean and efficient code in my projects. This pairs well with my time-management skills and strong multitasking ability. 
        I have applied these skills in the real world when I worked in Quality Assurance for a call-center as a data tracker. I developed systems for tracking call data and wrote programs to represent that data in usable ways to management personnel.
